/* ==========================================================================
   SILVER LAYER: LISTINGS ENRICHED (WHITESPACE CLEANING & DEDUPLICATION)
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   File: 03_silver_listings_consolidation.sql
   Objective: 
     1. Clean Listings & Metrics.
     2. DEDUPLICATE NEIGHBORHOODS: Collapse " Jurica" and "Jurica" into one entry.
     3. TEXT JOIN: Link Listing to the unique Neighborhood key.
     4. SPATIAL JOIN: Link inherited geometry to Grid.
