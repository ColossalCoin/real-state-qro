   FEATURE ENGINEERING: SPATIAL DISTANCES TO AMENITIES

   Description:
     Calculates the geodesic distance (in meters) from each listing to the nearest
     point of interest (POI) for various categories (schools, parks, hospitals, etc.).

   Logic & Assumptions:
     1. Search Radius: We restrict the search to a 5km (5000m) radius using ST_DWITHIN
        to optimize BigQuery geospatial computation costs.
     2. Nearest Neighbor: For each listing, we only keep the SINGLE nearest amenity
        per category.
     3. Imputation (The "5km Rule"): If no amenity of a specific type is found
        within the 5km radius, the value is imputed as 5000. This acts as a
        "distance penalty" for the model, treating missing data as "far away"
        rather than NULL.

   Input Tables:
     - dim_listings (Silver Layer)
     - dim_context_amenities (Silver Layer)

   Output Table:
     - int_geo_features_distances (Intermediate/Feature Layer)
